# TotK-Compendium-API

A very simple read only REST API for the new Zelda game, Tears of the Kingdom.

This Project is still very much a work-in-progress. If the API suddendly stops working, it will probably come back up sooner or later. 
Because of this, **please don't make any huge projects that rely on this API!**

This project was made by me and I have built this from the ground up.
